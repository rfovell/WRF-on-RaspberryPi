These notes and materials represent an attempt to run the WRF-ARW modeling system (WRF and WPS) on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16 GB RAM.
The details are contained in the file ATM419_WRF_RaspberryPi_script.pdf, which is also hosted on my NWP class page (https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/rfovell/NWP/).

The goal is to run WRF as one would on any other Linux system, as a companion to the container-and-notebook based project at https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf
